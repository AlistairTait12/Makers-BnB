# Makers-BnB

This project is an AirBnB clone. Our goal of this project is to create an app where a user can list a space for a customer to rent.


- As a signed up user
- So my space can be advertised
- I can list a new space

- As a signed up user
- So I can make more money
- I can advertise multiple spaces

- As a user
- So that customers can see information about my space
- I can name my space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.

- As a user
- So that I can manage bookings
- I can list a range of dates when my space is available

- As a customer
- So that I can stay somewhere short-term
- I can book a space for one night

- As a user
- So that I can control who stays at my space
- I can approve a potential customer

- As a user
- So my space doesn't become double booked
- I can block out dates where the space is not available

- As a customer
- So that I can see all potential spaces
- A space will stay open until a request has been confirmed by the user

- As a user
- So I can choose the customer
- People can request to book a space until I confirm a booking
